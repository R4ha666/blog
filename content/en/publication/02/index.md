# 📄 Markup Languages. LaTeX

Markup languages are systems for describing the structure and formatting of text. They allow the author to focus on the content while the system takes care of formatting. One of the most powerful and widely recognized markup languages in academia is **LaTeX**.

## 🔍 What is LaTeX?

**LaTeX** (pronounced “Lah-tech” or “Lay-tech”) is a macro package built on top of TeX, designed for creating professionally formatted documents. It is especially popular among scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and programmers for its precise typography and powerful formatting capabilities.

## 🧠 Why LaTeX?

LaTeX has several advantages over traditional word processors:

- **Separation of content and formatting**: the author defines the logical structure, and the system handles the appearance.
- **High typographic quality**: LaTeX produces perfectly aligned documents with elegant fonts, clean equations, and well-formatted tables.
- **Excellent math support**: complex mathematical expressions, proofs, and diagrams can be typeset easily.
- **Flexibility and extensibility**: LaTeX supports a vast number of packages for tables, figures, algorithms, references, citations, and more.
- **Automation**: automatic generation of table of contents, references, numbered equations, and cross-referencing.
