## ðŸ“š Week 5 (June 17â€“22)

I completed the **final programming exam**. The task was to implement a quicksort algorithm and a student management system using structures. It went well â€” the examiner praised the clean code and comments.

This marks the end of my first academic year at RUDN University. It was challenging but incredibly interesting. Iâ€™ve grown in my understanding of algorithms, mathematical analysis, and logic. Now it's time for a short break â€” and then on to new knowledge!
