## ðŸ“š Week 3 (June 3â€“8)

Final sessions in **mathematical analysis** â€” we discussed integrals and properties of antiderivatives. We had a test covering both definite integrals and theorem proofs.

Exam prep in **logic** has also started â€” weâ€™re going through past-year problems, especially those involving deductive reasoning. In the evenings, I rewatch lectures â€” it helps organize the material in my head.
