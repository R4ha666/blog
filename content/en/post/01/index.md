## ðŸ“š Week 1 (May 20â€“25)

During our **programming** classes, we started exploring recursion and its applications in problem solving. I especially enjoyed the topic of tree traversal and calculating factorials â€” it really helped me understand how recursion works "under the hood".

In addition, we began active preparation for the **mathematical analysis exam**. Iâ€™m reviewing topics like limits, continuity, and derivatives. It's still challenging, but feels more intuitive now compared to the beginning of the semester.
