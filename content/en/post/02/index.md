## ðŸ“š Week 2 (May 27 â€“ June 1)

The week started with a **mathematical logic lab**. We solved problems involving truth tables and tautology proofs. We're learning the resolution method â€” it's tricky but very engaging.

We also had a **programming test**: we wrote a simple console game in C++ using arrays and functions. I got a high score, although I got a bit confused with the logic conditions â€” but Iâ€™ve learned from it.
