## ðŸ“š Week 4 (June 10â€“15)

The most important event this week was the **mathematical logic exam**. I got a ticket with tasks on normal forms and logical derivations. Solved it confidently â€” not a single lecture note went to waste!

In parallel, Iâ€™ve been actively revising **programming**: sorting algorithms, data structures, and the basics of OOP. Preparing for the final exam by writing cheat sheets and practicing with old test problems.
